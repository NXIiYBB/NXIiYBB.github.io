        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Yubol Buasing. I'm a second-year Digital Media Engineering student at Khon Kaen University with a strong interest in web development.
            I enjoy building clean, user-friendly websites and constantly seek to improve my front-end and back-end skills. My goal is to create digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose Digital Media Engineering because it combines creativity and technology — two things I’m passionate about. I’m especially drawn to web development,
            where I can design and build digital experiences that are both functional and engaging.
        </p>

            <h4>Equipment Borrowing System for Laboratory Facilities Project: Challenges and Solutions</h4>
            <p>July 9, 2025</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    One of the most interesting projects I worked on was a demo web application for managing equipment borrowing in the CDLC room. I developed the system using Django, and it included separate interfaces for admins and users, as well as a request and approval process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major challenge I faced was designing a system that handled user roles effectively. Making sure admins had different access levels from regular users required a deeper understanding of Django’s authentication system. I also had to deal with database relationships, especially linking borrowed items to user records and approval statuses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this project taught me how to turn an idea into a functional system and how to handle real-world development problems — both technically and in terms of user experience.
